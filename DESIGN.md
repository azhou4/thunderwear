# all about that design

A ground-breaking, earth-shattering iOS app that will revolutionize your life.
Global warming. CS50 Psets. Trump. All these factors impede our productivity. But don't worry, Thunderwear is here to save the day.

This is THUNDERWEAR.

Upon the simple press of a button, combining the most recent local weather information, Thunderwear will provide you with accurate knowledge of the most suitable outfit to wear. Thunderwear is intended for all audiences to easily manage their outfit choices, dressing appropriately through all four seasons, all year round, rain or shine.

## general

Thunderwear was designed in two main components: the "front end" coded in Swift, and the "back end" coded in Python and using Flask. Together, they work to produce the iOS app, sending location information and weather information back and forth to get outfit suggestions.

## swift front end

- alamofire/pods

- swift/xcode

### main storyboard

The storyboard gives a visual representation of what the app looks like.

**add more here, jess, because I can't view the storyboard from my computer :(**

### viewcontroller

The viewcontroller is where the code for the storyboard is placed. In Thunderwear, there are two viewcontrollers, one for each distinct screen.



## python/flask back end

**this space is for you sang-o**
- api
- talk about the algorithm here
- php tables
- list out all the static clothing types, and also the temperature ranges

## overall comments and future improvements



A "design document" for your project in the form of a Markdown file called DESIGN.md that discusses, technically, how you implemented your project and why you made the design decisions you did. Your design document should be at least several paragraphs in length. Whereas your documentation is meant to be a userâ€™s manual, consider your design document your opportunity to give the staff a technical tour of your project underneath its hood.
