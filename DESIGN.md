# all about that design

A ground-breaking, earth-shattering iOS app that will revolutionize your life.
Global warming. CS50 Psets. Trump. All these factors impede our productivity. But don't worry, Thunderwear is here to save the day.

This is **THUNDERWEAR**.

Upon the simple press of a button, combining the most recent local weather information, Thunderwear will provide you with accurate knowledge of the most suitable outfit to wear. Thunderwear is intended for all audiences to easily manage their outfit choices, dressing appropriately through all four seasons, all year round, rain or shine.

## general

Thunderwear was designed in two main components: the "front end" coded in Swift, and the "back end" coded in Python and using Flask. Together, they work to produce the iOS app, sending location information and weather information back and forth to get outfit suggestions.

## swift front end

The front end of Thunderwear was coded in Swift 3 and run in the program Xcode 9. The library Alamofire **add link** was used to assist in the communication between the front end and back end of the app.

### main storyboard

The storyboard gives a visual representation of what the app looks like.

### viewcontroller

The viewcontroller is where the code for the storyboard is placed. In Thunderwear, there are two viewcontrollers, one for each distinct screen.

The first viewcontroller handles the home page as well as the display of weather information. Therefore, before the user inputs a location, the headers mentioned in the Readme file ("Outfit Recommendations," "Weather," "Today's Temperature") must be hidden. Therefore, when the user initially opens the app, only the button "**Input Location**" is present. Once the user inputs the location, the code shows the previously mentioned headers as well as the weather information.

Depending on the weather conditions, the background of the viewcontroller will change. To do this, the viewcontroller gets the weather code from the weatherInfo array. If the first digit of the code is "2," "3," or "5," signifying there is some form of rain, the background will change to different rain backgrounds and will warn the user to bring an umbrella and a rain jacket. If the frst digit of the code is "6" or "7," signifying there is no rain, the background will change to an image relevant to the weather condition. This design enhances the visual appeal of the app, improves user experience and enhances the quality of the weather/outfit suggestion.

Lastly, the getOutfit button in viewcontroller sends an Alamofire request to the back end,

### second viewcontroller

The second viewcontroller allows the user to input location information.

## python/flask back end

**this space is for you sang-o**
- api
- talk about the algorithm here
- php tables
- list out all the static clothing types, and also the temperature ranges

## logo

We wanted to design a simple, clean, easily recognizable, yet unique logo. Combining a cloud, sun, and clothes hanger, we designed a logo that encapsulates the functionality and purpose of Thunderwear. The logo was designed using the online service Canva **add link**.

The specs:

A "design document" for your project in the form of a Markdown file called DESIGN.md that discusses, technically, how you implemented your project and why you made the design decisions you did. Your design document should be at least several paragraphs in length. Whereas your documentation is meant to be a userâ€™s manual, consider your design document your opportunity to give the staff a technical tour of your project underneath its hood.
