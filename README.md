# thunderwear

A ground-breaking, earth-shattering iOS app that will revolutionize your life.

This is THUNDERWEAR.

Global warming. CS50 Psets. Trump. All these factors impede our productivity. Thunderwear is here to save the day.

Upon the simple press of a button, combining the most recent local weather information, Thunderwear will provide you with the most accurate knowledge of the most suitable outfit to wear.

## setup

Thunderwear is extremely user-friendly. To access, simply download the Thunderwear folder on Github and open the project in Xcode. Ensure you have set up an account and have allocated a Team in the Project Settings of Xcode before attempting to run the app on your own device. Once setup, connect your iOS device to your computer and press the Play button on the top left of the screen to run Thunderwear on your own device.

## features

Upon opening Thunderwear, the user will be greeted by the home page. To start, press the "Input Location" button. The user will be redirected to the Location page, where they can input either their current location, or any location in the entire world. The location can be inputted in many formats, similar to the way locations can be inputted in Google Maps.

Documentation for your project in the form of a Markdown file called README.md. This documentation is to be a userâ€™s manual for your project. Though the structure of your documentation is entirely up to you, it should be incredibly clear to the staff how and where, if applicable, to compile, configure, and use your project. Your documentation should be at least several paragraphs in length. It should not be necessary for us to contact you with questions regarding your project after its submission. Hold our hand with this documentation; be sure to answer in your documentation any questions that you think we might have while testing your work.
