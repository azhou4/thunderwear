A ground-breaking, earth-shattering iOS app that will revolutionize your life.
Global warming. CS50 Psets. Trump. All these factors impede our productivity. But don't worry, Thunderwear is here to save the day.

This is **THUNDERWEAR**.

Upon the simple press of a button, combining the most recent local weather information, Thunderwear will provide you with accurate knowledge of the most suitable outfit to wear. Thunderwear is intended for all audiences to easily manage their outfit choices, dressing appropriately through all four seasons, all year round, rain or shine.

## setup

Since Thunderwear has not yet been published in the app store, the Github Xcode file must be downloaded in order to access the iOS app. To access, simply download the Thunderwear folder on Github and open the project in Xcode. Ensure you have set up an account, allocated a Team, and also entered in your Apple credentials in the Project Settings of Xcode before attempting to run the app on your own device. Once setup, connect your iOS device to your computer and press the Play button on the top left of the screen to run Thunderwear on your own device.

## features

Thunderwear was designed to be extremely intuitive and user-friendly. Upon opening Thunderwear, the user is greeted by the home page. The home page is simple and clean, displaying only the Thunderwear logo and a button labelled "**Input Location**." To start, press the "**Input Location**" button. The user is redirected to the Location page, where they can input either their current location, or any location in the entire world. For ease of use, the location can be inputted in many formats (i.e. Street Address, City; City, State, Country; Zip code; Longitude, Latitude; etc.), similar to the way locations can be inputted in Google Maps.

After entering location, clicking "**Submit**" will bring the user back to the home page. This time, however, the home page will display a variety of features to help guide the user to choose an outfit to wear. Firstly, the background of the screen will change depending on the weather conditions of the location. For example, if there is a chance of precipitation, the background of the app will emulate rain. Secondly, under the header "*Outfit Recommendations*," dynamically suggested clothing items such as short-sleeve shirt, long pants, coat/jacket will be made, depending on the weather forecast and temperature of the location. Underneath "*Outfit Recommendations*," the "*Weather*" heading will provide additional advice regarding the weather, such as remembering to bring an umbrella on a rainy day. In addition, there is a header called "*Today's Temperature*" that displays the High and Low temperatures. Lastly, there is another "**Input Location**" button at the bottom, allowing the user to easily look up another location if needed.

Although simple, we believe Thunderwear has the potential to make a real positive impact on people's lives. We hope you enjoy using our very first iOS app!
